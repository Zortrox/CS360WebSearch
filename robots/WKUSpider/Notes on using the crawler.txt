The crawler got a mini makeover in functionality.

Fixes:
The database statements and results are hopefully all closed now
The page parser now collections more information than ever, but loses some weight accuracy.
the Driver(Testing) now has commands


Driver's new commands
-start 		: starts the spider
-display 		: enter the database name to display its contents
-amt 		: set the amount of pages for each thread to transverse
-numOfThreads 	: set the maximum number of threads to use
-startURL 		: enter the starting URL location
